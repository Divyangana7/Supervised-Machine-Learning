**Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**
In this problem I will be working with three datasets for regression:

**Housing**: This is a regression dataset where the task is to
  predict the value of houses in the suburbs of Boston based
  on thirteen features that describe different aspects that are
  relevant to determining the value of a house, such as the
  number of rooms, levels of pollution in the area, etc.
  
**Yacht**:  This is a regression dataset where the task is to
  predict the resistance of a sailing yachtâ€™s structure based on
  six different features that describe structural and buoyancy
  properties.
  
**Concrete**: This is a regression dataset where the task is to
  predict   the   compressive   strength   of   concrete   on   eight
  different features. There are a total of 1030 instances and all
  the features are numeric.
